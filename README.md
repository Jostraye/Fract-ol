# Fract-ol

Fract'ol is a program that lets you explore the psychedelichttps://github.com/Jostraye/Fract-ol/wiki universe of 7 fractals, including the Madelbort and Julia sets.

The executable is called fractol, you can execute it without argument: this will bring you on the famous Madelbrot set. You can also choose to pass it as an argument any number between 1 and 7.
The progem allows you to move around, you can zom in and out using the mouse wheel, switch from one fractal to another, change the colors and sharpen the shape of the fractal.

Please explore this project, I hope you can too fall in love with the beauty of those mathematical objects. Below are some examples of the intriguing shapes you can stumble upon in my program:


The famous Madelbrot set

An interesting piece of fractals that reminds me of dentelle (cloth ornements)

One of the funky Julia sets

A fractal that surprisingly ressembles the shape of China, or maybe a chicken!

The famous Burning Ship fractal (you can find it on the burning ship fractal if you zoom in on the left of the set)
